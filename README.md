Raid Percentage Point Tracker for Everquest

Project Pitch: Back in 1999 a game called Everquest was released. This was a virtual world designed around the fantasy game Dungeons and Dragons. This game allows large groups of more adventurous players to tackle stronger enemies. These "get togethers" are called Raids.

Killing the stronger enemies produces a small amount of armor as a reward. To avoid arguments over who gets to equip the armor on their character a system was developed to allow players to earn points. 

This application will provide a method to track Raids, Enemies, Players, Points, Attendance and Rewards. An administrator user will be responsible for entering data into the system. Non-admin users will be able to see the points they've earned and spent.

User Stories:
A non-logged in user will be able to view a table showing raid attendance, points earned and points spent for all members

A logged-in Admin user will be able to create raids, check-in/out players from the raid, create new players, add players to the raid, apply bonus points, create rewards, assign rewards to a player, create events, assign rewards to events
